# Campaign Playbook - Foundational Thinking

Everything here was discussed and pressure-tested. The playbook gets built from this.

---

## The Orientation

The wrong way to think about this campaign is as a fundraiser. "How do we raise £10,000?" is the wrong starting question. It leads to extractive thinking: squeezing donations, pressuring contacts, measuring success in pounds collected. That's not what this is.

Our campaign is built around a social cause we studied and couldn't ignore. Homelessness in England is getting worse and temporary relief doesn't solve it. What solves it is employment, and Change Please has been proving that for years. They train people experiencing homelessness, give them a London Living Wage job, housing, therapy, and a future. 82% of their graduates stay employed. We're raising £10,000 to fund those training placements, but the way we raise it is by telling that story and letting people decide they want to be part of it. Not by chasing them.

Every decision, every stakeholder conversation, every piece of content should pass through this filter: are we building genuine connection to the cause, or are we just chasing money? Whether it's the SU, Jo, or the press, they all hear the same thing: "we're addressing homelessness through employment, here's how you can be part of it."

---

## The WHY

What resonates with people is the social cause itself. Not the charity. Not the brand. The need to address homelessness, and one vetted way to do that is to provide employment rather than handouts that only offer temporary effects. The evidence that this works is Change Please.

Homelessness in England is growing. 300,000 households are experiencing the worst forms of it. Shelters, food banks, temporary support: these things keep people alive but they don't get them out. People cycle back. The system addresses symptoms but not the root. What actually works is giving someone a skill, a wage, and a reason to show up tomorrow. Employment, not handouts. A path back into society that sticks, not a safety net that catches and releases.

Change Please Foundation runs 12-week barista training programmes for people experiencing homelessness. Graduates get the London Living Wage, housing, therapy, financial coaching, and a structured path to sustained employment. 82% of graduates sustain that employment. 3,283 lives changed. When someone asks "does this actually make a difference?" the answer is yes, and the numbers back it up.

This team studied the Change Please model as part of Dr Tabish's module. They visited the operation, met the people behind it, and decided to go beyond completing an assignment. £10,000 funds multiple training placements. Each placement takes one person from experiencing homelessness into a living-wage job, a home, therapy, and a future.

The cause is homelessness and the fact that it needs employment solutions, not temporary relief. The proof is Change Please: a model that works, with numbers that back it. The action is this team turning academic study into a campaign that funds real training placements.

## The HOW

The HOW isn't "circles of trust to generate donations." That describes a mechanic but doesn't explain how the campaign actually works.

Our job is to build genuine awareness and connection between people and this cause, and give them a clear way to act on it. The JustGiving page, the events, the university payment system are channels. What makes people use them is understanding the problem and believing their contribution changes it.

The campaign reaches people through concentric circles of trust, and each circle works differently.

The **inner circle** is people the team personally knows. Family, friends, classmates, colleagues. They act because they know you, trust you, and you asked them directly. Not through a post. Not through a link. Through a conversation. This is where the first momentum comes from. If your own circle doesn't believe in it enough to give, nobody else will either.

The **extended circle** is people one step removed. Jo's Entrepreneurs in Residence, contacts from the Glasshouse event, faculty networks, the SU audience. These people don't know the team personally but they trust the person who introduced them. A professor recommending the campaign carries weight. An entrepreneur saying "I've looked at this, it's worth supporting" opens wallets. Trust here is borrowed from credible sources.

The **open circle** is everyone else. People who encounter the campaign through press coverage, Change Please's own channels, or social media. They have no personal connection to anyone involved. They act because the cause itself is compelling and because visible momentum on the page (donations, institutional backing, press) makes it feel real.

A personal ask works for the inner circle. An introduction from someone credible works for the extended circle. A compelling story backed by visible momentum works for the open circle.

Money flows through whichever channel works for the donor. We should not limit collection to JustGiving. Dr Tabish already mentioned a university payment system through Dan Berger. Jo may have a different approach for her network. The options need to exist and the clarity is that it all routes to Change Please Foundation securely regardless of how it comes in. No donor should get stuck because we only set up one way to give.

The money math still matters operationally. We need to track what comes in and where. But it's a back-office function, not the campaign's architecture.

---

## The WHO

**Dr Tabish Zaman** is the faculty lead. He opens doors the team can't. The Dean of FBL, Dan Berger for the payment system, university infrastructure, event funding conversations. He holds the primary relationship with Change Please. He provides the academic authority and ethics clearance that make this legitimate. Without his endorsement this is just students with a JustGiving page.

**The core team** is five people. Each one owns a domain and a set of stakeholder relationships. They don't do everything themselves. Their job is to drive their relationships to produce results. Vivian doesn't design every poster. She drives the Change Please Marketing relationship and coordinates events. Mohamed doesn't message every Glasshouse contact personally. He owns that outreach pipeline and makes sure it produces.

**External stakeholders** each contribute something the team doesn't have on its own. The SU has student reach the team can't match. Jo Living has a professional network the team can't access. Change Please has content, credibility, and brand the team can't create from scratch. The press has public reach beyond campus. Societies multiply campus touchpoints without the core team doing all the grunt work.

The playbook is what tells each of these people what they need to do and how it connects.

---

## The Playbook Design

The playbook is a delegation tool. The goal is absolutes. When this gets handed down to the respective team leads, they should be able to review and execute. They take the brief to the relevant stakeholder and that triggers a meeting with the external or internal department. The SU may want more clarification. They may want to sit down and see where they could align given their own internal workings. They might already have a plan for how to support the campaign once they see the ask. But the starting point is clear and specific enough that those conversations are productive, not exploratory.

So Anita takes her brief to the SU. She doesn't walk in with "hi, could you maybe help us out?" She walks in with a specific proposal that says what we're doing, what we need from them, how it benefits their students, and what the outcomes look like. The SU responds to something concrete. They might say "newsletter yes, event co-hosting needs discussion because we have our own calendar." That's alignment. That's productive. That's what prepared looks like.

Each section is self-contained. Precise enough to trigger execution, flexible enough to work with whatever the stakeholder already has going on. Deliverables are specific but there's room for adjustment. "Feature in the March newsletter" is specific. "Support our campaign" is not. Nobody should read their brief and feel like they need another meeting just to understand what's being asked.

The playbook isn't a compilation of jargon repeating the same thing. It knows what to do. It answers the important questions. It has a clear and precise vision that fuels the different sections.

A specific task within the playbook may need revision, a pivot, or a rethink. That's fine. But revisions happen within the structure, not by going back to the drawing board. The framework holds even when individual pieces move. That's what separates being prepared from wasting time with random suggestions in calls that warrant starting over.

---

## Tracking and Operations

The playbook needs operational todos baked in. Not as an afterthought but as a function someone owns. Consolidation: how all donation channels feed into one view. Tracking: what came in, from where, through which channel. Validation: did the money actually reach Change Please. Compilation and traceability: every pound accounted for.

This way Israel can assign someone to own this function, and that person provides regular updates. It moves the campaign from planning into execution even while specific tasks are still being refined. Inline planning to execute. Not "plan everything, then start." Plan, execute, adjust, keep going.

---

## All Layers

### 1. The Cause (LOCKED)
Homelessness needs employment solutions, not temporary relief. Change Please is the proof that this works. This team is turning study into action.

### 2. The Campaign Model (LOCKED)
Concentric circles of trust. Social-first orientation. Build awareness, connect people, give them a way to act. Multiple collection channels, all routed to Change Please.

### 3. The People (LOCKED)
Dr Tabish opens institutional doors. The core team each owns a domain and drives their stakeholder relationships. External stakeholders contribute what the team can't produce alone.

### 4. The Money (OPERATIONAL ONLY)
How much do we care about hitting £10,000 on a scale of 1 to 10? About a 1. As much as we want the money, the campaign is not built for the money. Chasing donations negates the social enterprise mindset. The money matters but it's a consequence of doing the campaign right. Operationally we still handle it properly: track what comes in, consolidate across channels, make sure it reaches Change Please. JustGiving takes about 5%. Gift Aid adds 25% for UK taxpayers. University system terms still to be confirmed with Dan Berger. All back-office work.

### 5. The Sequence (LOCKED)
Nothing waits for everything else to be ready. Everything moves in parallel, and items that need external confirmation are tracked with contingency plans so they don't hold anything up.

Everything starts now, simultaneously:
- JustGiving page gets set up (Israel)
- Content bank gets created (Vignesh, Anita)
- Stakeholder briefs go out to team leads
- Team leads approach their stakeholders
- Event planning begins

Items tracked for status (not blockers, but need contingency plans):
- Payment infrastructure (Dr Tabish / Dan Berger). Contingency: if the university system isn't ready in time, JustGiving handles everything and in-person collections use QR codes
- Ethics clearance. Contingency: if there are constraints, adjust scope to fit within them
- Toolkit review (Vivian). Contingency: create content from what we already have, supplement when toolkit review is done

The only real dependencies are logical and within the team's control:
- You can't amplify content that doesn't exist yet
- You can't promote events without dates
- You can't send stakeholder briefs that haven't been written

These are production tasks, not approvals. They don't wait on anyone outside the team.

### 6. The Content (PARTLY DONE)
Already done: campaign one-pager, academic one-pager, 8-page proposal, Change Please toolkit (forwarded to team, Vivian reviewing).

Still needed: 10-15 social media posts ready to go, email templates for SU newsletter and faculty announcement and staff newsletter, event graphics, story and reel templates for team and partner channels, campus screen slides at 16:9.

Vignesh creates content. Anita designs. Israel writes copy.

### 7. The Events (LOCKED)
Two events confirmed by Dr Tabish (through Anita, 24 Feb).

#### Pre-Launch Event

**Purpose:** Internal awareness, team credibility, and content generation. The first time this campaign goes public, so it needs to set the right tone.

**Audience:** MBA cohort, invited faculty, friends of the team. Expect 40-60 people realistically.

**Format:** Film screening + campaign introduction + Iftar feast.

**The film:** Change Please has video content on their website and YouTube. The toolkit Vivian is reviewing may include a documentary or promotional video. If there's a full-length documentary, screen it. If not, a 15-20 minute compilation of Change Please video content works. Vivian confirms what's available when she connects with the Change Please Marketing Manager.

**Run of show (tentative):**
- 6:30pm: Doors open. QR code table cards already placed on every table linking to JustGiving page
- 7:00pm: Film screening begins (15-30 min depending on what's available)
- 7:30pm: Dr Tabish speaks. Introduces the campaign, explains the module connection, sets the tone. 10 minutes max
- 7:40pm: Israel gives a brief, direct ask. "Here's the JustGiving page, here's the QR code in front of you, here's what £10 does." 3 minutes
- 7:45pm: Iftar feast begins. Informal networking, conversations, one-on-one asks from team members working the room
- 8:30pm: Event wraps

**Donation mechanism:** QR codes on every table linking to JustGiving. Verbal ask from Israel after Dr Tabish speaks. Team members personally approach people during the Iftar for face-to-face asks (inner circle activation).

**Catering:** Iftar feast. Dr Tabish was going to negotiate university event funding for this. If university covers it, cost is zero. If not, the team needs to budget for catering. Community Iftar catering or homemade/potluck is a backup option that also builds authenticity.

**Food and drink considerations:**
- Iftar is inherently halal. But the guest list is diverse so options should accommodate everyone
- Vegetarian and vegan options alongside meat dishes
- Allergen labelling on all dishes: nuts, gluten, dairy at minimum. Small printed cards next to each dish
- Water, juice, and non-alcoholic drinks. No alcohol at an Iftar
- If doing potluck/homemade, each contributor lists ingredients for allergen tracking
- Ask dietary requirements on the RSVP or event sign-up. Simple question: "Any dietary requirements? (allergies, vegetarian, vegan, halal, other)"

**Venue:** Campus room with a screen for the film, seating for 40-60, and space for food. Dr Tabish facilitates the booking.

**Equipment:** Projector and screen (should be in the room), laptop for film playback, mic if the room is large enough to need one.

**Photography and content:** Anita assigns a photographer (or does it herself). This event generates social content for the public launch phase. Photos of the room, the food, Dr Tabish speaking, people watching the film, team together. Video clips for Instagram stories and reels.

#### Formal Launch Event

**Purpose:** Credibility, professional engagement, larger donations, and press coverage. Where the extended circle gets activated.

**Audience:** Entrepreneurs, industry contacts, EiRs (through Jo), Glasshouse contacts (through Mohamed), faculty, press (Jamie Forsyth / ARU Press Office). Expect 30-50 people. Quality over quantity.

**Format:** Keynote/talk from Change Please representative, followed by campaign overview, followed by networking with donation opportunities.

**Speaker:** A Change Please representative. Could be a programme lead, a graduate who's been through the training, or a marketing rep who can tell the story. Vivian requests this when she calls the Change Please Marketing Manager. If Change Please can't provide someone in person, a video call projected on screen works, or a pre-recorded video message from a graduate.

**Run of show (tentative):**
- 6:00pm: Doors open. QR codes on tables. Welcome drinks if budget allows
- 6:30pm: Israel or Dr Tabish opens. Brief context, 5 minutes
- 6:35pm: Change Please speaker. How the model works, what it's achieved, who it's helped. 15-20 minutes
- 6:55pm: Q&A. 10 minutes
- 7:05pm: The ask. Israel presents the campaign, the JustGiving page on screen, the QR codes, and any raffle/auction happening. 5 minutes
- 7:10pm: Raffle draw or silent auction results (if applicable)
- 7:15pm: Networking. Team members work the room for personal conversations and asks
- 8:00pm: Event wraps

**Donation mechanism:** QR codes on tables (same as pre-launch). Plus raffle and/or silent auction if prizes are secured. Jo suggested raffles, skills auctions. Change Please might offer a coffee subscription prize. Local businesses might donate prizes if Mohamed or Jo make introductions.

**MC:** Israel or Dr Tabish. Whoever is more comfortable with a room of professionals.

**Invitation list (Mohamed builds this):**
- Jo Living's EiRs (Cambridge-based priority: Alex Mann, Lucy Colson, Nick Looby, Nish Kotak, Faye Holland, Dr Tamsin Holland-Brown)
- Glasshouse contacts from the Feb event
- Faculty and university leadership (Dean of FBL, MBA Director)
- Jamie Forsyth / ARU Press Office
- Any local business contacts the team has

**Catering:** More professional than Iftar. Finger food, canapes, drinks. This costs money and needs budget.

**Food and drink considerations:**
- Mixed audience including professionals, entrepreneurs, and faculty. Menu should be inclusive by default
- Halal, vegetarian, and vegan options as standard. Not on request, just there
- Allergen labels on all items. Printed tent cards next to each platter: ingredients and allergen flags (nuts, gluten, dairy, shellfish)
- Drinks: soft drinks, juice, tea/coffee. If alcohol is served (wine, beer), it should be alongside clear non-alcoholic alternatives. University room booking policies may have rules on alcohol
- Ask dietary requirements on the invitation RSVP. Same question as pre-launch: "Any dietary requirements?"

**Venue:** Campus room with professional setup. Podium or speaker area. Projector, mic, good lighting. Dr Tabish facilitates booking.

**Equipment:** Projector, mic, podium or speaker area, laptop for presentations, camera for press-quality photos.

**Photography and content:** Anita arranges a photographer. Professional-quality photos for press release, LinkedIn posts, ARU News feature. Video clips of the Change Please speaker for social content.

## Dr Tabish's Podcast - Builders of the Broken Bazaar

**The podcast:** Dr Tabish hosts "Builders of the Broken Bazaar," a podcast about entrepreneurship in fragile and challenging contexts. Refugees, migrants, informal entrepreneurs, displaced communities rebuilding through enterprise. The core thesis is that entrepreneurship is not just about profit and scale. It's about dignity, care, and reconstructing systems.

**Scale and presence:**
- 19+ episodes published (Aug 2025 to present)
- Available on YouTube (141 subscribers, episodes getting 30-185 views), Apple Podcasts, Castbox, RSS
- Instagram: @buildersofthebrokenbazaar
- Notable guests include CEOs, professors, founders working in crisis entrepreneurship, AI ethics, healthcare, refugee integration
- Dr Tabish is speaking at the **Cambridge Festival on 24 March 2026** (6-7pm, at ARU) with a session titled "Stories from Builders of the Broken Bazaar" - challenging conventional entrepreneurship and exploring how innovation serves society rather than just markets

**Why this matters for the campaign:**

The podcast and the campaign are built on the same foundation. The podcast says entrepreneurship should serve people, not extract from them. The campaign says the same thing through action. Change Please is exactly the kind of enterprise the podcast celebrates: built in the cracks, serving people the system forgot, proving that business can restore dignity.

Dr Tabish is likely building something larger here. The campaign, the podcast, the Cambridge Festival talk, his module. These are all pieces of the same picture: establishing himself and ARU as a centre for social enterprise thinking. The campaign is a live case study that proves his thesis. The podcast is the platform that tells these stories. The Cambridge Festival is the stage.

**How to integrate intelligently:**

This should not feel bolted on. The podcast is not a logo to slap on the event poster. It's the intellectual context that makes the campaign more than a student fundraiser.

1. **The pre-launch event can mention the podcast naturally.** When Dr Tabish speaks, he introduces the campaign in the context of his broader work: "I study entrepreneurs who build in broken systems. Change Please is one of them. My students decided to do more than study it." If people are interested in the podcast, he can mention it. It's not the focus, it's the context.

2. **The formal launch event sits naturally alongside the Cambridge Festival talk (24 March).** If the formal launch is timed close to the festival, Dr Tabish can mention both at each. "I'm speaking about this at the Cambridge Festival next week" or "We launched this campaign at ARU last week." Cross-pollination without forcing it.

3. **A podcast episode about the campaign.** Dr Tabish already planned to record a podcast after the events. This becomes a reflection episode: the team's journey, what they learned, the results. It documents the campaign for future cohorts AND creates content that lives beyond the campaign window. The episode features the team, possibly a Change Please representative, and captures the story.

4. **Content that references the podcast expands the campaign's reach.** A LinkedIn post from Israel that says "Our campaign is part of a bigger conversation Dr Tabish is building through @buildersofthebrokenbazaar" connects the campaign to a wider narrative. It makes the campaign look like it's embedded in something real, not a standalone assignment.

5. **The Cambridge Festival (24 March) is a calendar anchor.** If the formal launch aligns with or follows the festival talk, the campaign benefits from the credibility of Dr Tabish speaking at a Cambridge institution about exactly this topic. Attendees at the festival talk could be directed to the JustGiving page or the formal launch event.

**What NOT to do:** Don't make the podcast the campaign's identity. The campaign is about homelessness and Change Please. The podcast is the intellectual home it sits within. The relationship should feel organic, like discovering that the professor behind the campaign also hosts a podcast about exactly this topic. Not manufactured.

## Timeline (TENTATIVE)

No dates are locked yet. Here's what a realistic campaign window looks like, working backwards from a logical end point.

The MBA module (MOD007665) likely runs through the spring semester. Ramadan 2026 starts around late February / early March, so the Iftar event needs to fall within Ramadan.

**Rough timeline:**
- **Week 1-2 (now):** Foundation. JustGiving page live. Content bank started. Stakeholder briefs written and distributed to team leads. Team leads begin approaching stakeholders
- **Week 3-4:** Soft launch. Personal stories go out on team members' channels. Personal asks to inner circle. SU newsletter feature. Faculty email
- **Week 4-5:** Pre-launch event (Iftar). First public moment. Content generated from event
- **Week 6-7:** Public launch. Institutional push. Press pitch. Content from pre-launch event used as proof of momentum
- **Week 8-9:** Formal launch event. Extended circle activated. Professional donations
- **Week 10-11:** Momentum phase. Milestone posts, social proof, "we're at £X"
- **Week 12:** Final push. Urgency. "£X to go." Direct asks to anyone who hasn't given
- **Week 12-13:** Close and celebration

This gives roughly 3 months. The exact dates depend on when events can be booked and when Ramadan falls. Dr Tabish and the team need to lock event dates first because everything else is scheduled around them.

## Budget

The campaign was designed to run on under £10 out of pocket for printed materials (A3 posters, A4 flyers, QR code cards).

Events change that. The main costs are:

**Pre-launch (Iftar):**
- Catering is the biggest cost. If university event funding covers it, cost is zero. If not, options range from professional catering (£200-500 depending on numbers) to community/homemade Iftar (much cheaper, more authentic)
- Room: should be free if booked through Dr Tabish
- AV equipment: should be in the room already

**Formal launch:**
- Catering: finger food and drinks for 30-50 professionals. Likely £300-600 if not covered by university
- Room: same as above, free through university
- AV: same as above

**Printed materials:**
- QR code table cards: printed in-house or at library. Under £5
- Event signage: under £5
- Any A3/A4 posters for campus: under £5

**Total realistic budget:** If university covers event catering, the campaign runs on under £10. If not, events could cost £500-1,000, which needs to be negotiated with Dr Tabish or absorbed by the team.

Dr Tabish was going to negotiate event funding with the university. The outcome of that conversation determines whether the team needs to fundraise for event costs before fundraising for the actual campaign. This is a priority action item.

---

## JustGiving Page

**The page needs to be set up before any public activity.** It's the single destination that every post, every email, every conversation, every QR code points to.

**Page copy** should tell the story in the same way the WHY section does: the cause (homelessness needs employment), the proof (Change Please, 82%, 3,283), the action (this team, this campaign, this amount).

**Goal shown:** £10,000.

**Imagery:** Change Please branding from the toolkit. Team photo. Campaign one-pager visuals.

**Beneficiary:** The page needs to route funds to Change Please Foundation. This needs to be confirmed with Change Please directly: does JustGiving pay out to their account? Do they need to approve the page? Is there a process for affiliated fundraising pages?

**Gift Aid:** JustGiving handles Gift Aid automatically if donors tick the box. Adds 25% on eligible donations.

**Fees:** JustGiving takes approximately 5% (platform fee + payment processing). On £10,000 that's roughly £500. The actual amount reaching Change Please would be around £9,500 before Gift Aid additions. Worth noting but not worth agonising over.

## Stakeholder Asks (Specific)

These are the concrete asks that go into each stakeholder brief in the playbook.

**Students' Union:**
1. Feature the campaign in one SU newsletter edition (we provide the copy and graphic, they slot it in)
2. Reshare 3-4 campaign posts/stories on SU Instagram when we tag them
3. Promote both events through SU channels (we provide event details and graphics)
4. Introduce us to leaders of relevant societies (entrepreneurship, volunteering, social justice)

**Jo Living:**
1. Introduce us to Cambridge-based EiRs who might attend the formal launch (we provide a brief she can forward)
2. Share the campaign on her LinkedIn with a personal recommendation
3. Donate (she offered)
4. Advise on raffle/auction mechanics and potential prize sources

**Change Please Marketing:**
1. Provide a speaker for the formal launch event (programme lead, graduate, or marketing rep)
2. Reshare campaign posts when we tag Change Please on social
3. Confirm permissions for using additional graduate stories and photos beyond the toolkit
4. Offer a raffle prize if possible (coffee subscription, branded merch)
5. Consider a co-branded press release or connect us with their PR contacts (optional, high impact)

**Faculty (Dean / MBA Director):**
1. One faculty-wide email endorsing the campaign (Israel drafts, they send)
2. 30-second classroom mentions in relevant modules
3. Attend the pre-launch event (visible support)

**Press (Jamie Forsyth / ARU Press Office):**
1. ARU News feature article (we provide quotes, photos, JustGiving link, background)
2. Pitch to Cambridge local press (we provide the story angle)
3. Send a photographer or reporter to the formal launch event

**Societies:**
1. Share the campaign with their members (we provide a short blurb and JustGiving link)
2. Attend and promote the pre-launch event (Iftar, open to all students)
3. Run a mini-fundraiser under the campaign if they're interested (bake sale, collection, activity). Optional but high impact

## Double or Divide

This is a viral donation mechanic. A person donates, then challenges two friends to either match their donation or split it between them. If someone gives £20, they tag two people. Those two each give £10 (split) or £20 (match). Then each of them tags two more.

It creates chain reactions. One donation becomes three. Three become nine. The maths compound quickly.

Vignesh creates a content template for this: a shareable graphic or story template that makes the mechanic clear and easy to participate in. The template needs to include the JustGiving link, the rules, and a visual that explains the split-or-match concept simply.

This gets deployed during the momentum phase of the comms arc, once the campaign has enough social proof that people don't feel weird participating.

## What's Next

All 13 layers are thought through. All gaps are filled with actual thinking. Where something is tentative (dates, budget amounts, speaker), it's marked as tentative with a clear path to confirming it. The playbook gets built from this.
