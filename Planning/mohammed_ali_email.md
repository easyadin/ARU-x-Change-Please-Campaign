Hi Professor Ali,

Thank you again for making the time to personally congratulate me and present my award yesterday — I really appreciate it.

As I briefly mentioned during our conversation, I'm leading a team of MBA students running a crowdfunding campaign in partnership with **Change Please** — the B Corp social enterprise (UK Social Enterprise of the Year 2025) that trains people experiencing homelessness as baristas, giving them a living wage job, housing, therapy, and a bank account. They've helped over 3,200 people with an 82% success rate.

We're raising **£10,000** through JustGiving to fund barista training placements directly through the Change Please Foundation. The project started in Dr. Tabish Zaman's module and has grown into a full campaign with a dedicated team.

Following your suggestion, I reached out to Jo Living at AREA. She's been really supportive and we've got a call scheduled for next Tuesday. She did mention, however, that AREA's remit is student startups and businesses, so things like university branding and match funding wouldn't come through her team. That's partly why I'm reaching out to you — we'd really value any help connecting with the Marketing and Comms team to explore how the university might support the campaign.

I've put together a draft proposal with all the details. You can view it online or via the attached PDF:

Any support or direction you could offer would be hugely valued.

Best regards,
