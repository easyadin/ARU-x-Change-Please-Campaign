Hi Jo,

It was great to briefly meet you at the Cambridge Dean Award event on 10 February. We didn't get the chance to chat properly, but you mentioned you'd be happy to hear more, so I wanted to follow up.

I'm Israel, an MBA student at ARU, and I'm leading a team running a crowdfunding campaign in partnership with **Change Please** — the B Corp social enterprise that trains people experiencing homelessness as baristas, providing them with a living wage job, housing within 10 days, therapy, and a bank account. They've helped over 3,200 people to date with an 82% success rate.

Our campaign is raising **£10,000** through JustGiving to fund barista training placements directly through the Change Please Foundation. The project grew out of our coursework under Dr. Tabish Zaman's module and has since developed into a real initiative with a full team behind it.

I also had the opportunity to speak with **Professor Mohammed Ali**, VPC and Dean of FBL, who was very supportive and encouraged me to reach out to you specifically — particularly around any matched funding opportunities or enterprise support that AREA might be able to offer.

I've put together a draft proposal that covers the campaign overview, Change Please's model, our team, and how the funds will be used. You can view it online or via the attached PDF:

We'd love any guidance you might have — whether that's around matched funding, enterprise support through AREA, or simply pointing us in the right direction. Happy to answer any questions over email.

Thank you for your time, Jo — really looking forward to connecting properly.

Best regards,
