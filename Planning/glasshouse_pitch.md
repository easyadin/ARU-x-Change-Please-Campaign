## The Script (~2 minutes)

### HOOK (15 sec)
> "Hi, my name is Vivian/Mohamed. We're a team of students from Anglia Ruskin University, and we're raising £10,000 to fund barista training placements for people experiencing homelessness — in partnership with Change Please, a social enterprise that has already helped over 3,000 people off the streets. We're running a university-backed crowdfunding campaign — every pound goes directly to Change Please Foundation through JustGiving."

### THE PROBLEM (20 sec)
> "Right now, over 9,500 people are sleeping rough in the UK — a 94% increase since 2021. 132,000 households are stuck in temporary accommodation. And the system keeps spending billions on emergency beds and hostels. But here's the thing — 31% of people who get housed end up back on the streets. Because a bed alone doesn't get someone off the streets permanently — without a job, a bank account, and mental health support, they end up right back where they started."

### THE SOLUTION — CHANGE PLEASE (25 sec)
> "That's where Change Please comes in. They're a B Corp–certified social enterprise — named UK Social Enterprise of the Year in 2025 — and they flip the model. Instead of shelter first, they lead with employment. A living wage barista job. Housing secured within 10 days. Therapy. A bank account. A real foundation to break the cycle of homelessness."
>
> "The results? 3,283 people lifted out of homelessness. An 82% success rate. Operations in 8 countries. And partnerships with Nespresso and the NHS worth millions."

### THE ASK (20 sec)
> "We're not here to ask you for money — though we won't say no."
>
> *(pause for laugh)*
>
> "What we're really here for is **connections**. If you know organisations that care about social impact, ESG, or community investment — introduce us. If you've run campaigns or built movements — we want to learn from you. And if you want to see what happens when students stop writing case studies and start building real social enterprises — follow our journey."

### CLOSE (10 sec)
> "Every person Change Please trains gets a job, a home, and a future — immediately. Help us fund more of that. Thank you."

## Tips for Delivery

1. **Memorise the hook** — name, who you are, what you're raising, done
2. **Slow down on the stats** — let 9,500 and 82% land
3. **The humour line ("we won't say no")** — only works if you commit to the pause
4. **End with confidence** — "Come find us after" is an invitation, deliver it like one
5. **Have QR codes ready** — JustGiving link on your phone or a printed card to hand out after
6. **Know your one-liner** for the networking after: *"We're crowdfunding to put homeless people into barista careers through Change Please — the social enterprise with an 82% success rate."*
