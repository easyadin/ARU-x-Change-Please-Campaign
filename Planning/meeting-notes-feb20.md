## Key Decisions & Direction

### Fundraising Target
- **Raised to £10,000–£15,000** (up from £5-10K)

### Money Handling — SOLVED ✅
- University will provide an **internal payment system**
- Resourcing team handles all money
- Direct transfer to Change Please
- No team member touches funds
- University certified, regulation compliant
- Expected to be confirmed after Monday meeting with Dan Berger

### Event Format — Needs Planning
Dr Tabish outlined options:
1. **Physical guest-only invite event** — guest speakers, discussion, workshop
2. **Online campaign running in parallel**
3. **Two separate events:**
   - One for external guests (already mobilised contacts)
   - One exclusively for students (guest speaker, discussion, talk)

### Social Media
- Vignesh volunteered — strong social media experience
- Plan: Create Instagram account for the campaign
- Dr Tabish fully supportive — "no limits"

### Podcast
- Dr Tabish suggested doing it **after the event** (not before)
- More impactful with outcomes to discuss
- Fits his podcast's marginal perspective theme

## Dr Tabish's Asks

### 1. One-Pager — "The Triangle" 📄
Dr Tabish needs a concise one-pager covering:
- **How it started** — origin of the initiative
- **Learning impact** — how it linked to classroom and outside learning (module MOD007665)
- **Where it's going** — what the campaign will do, its impact

*Purpose: Dr Tabish will use this to brief faculty, AREA, and stakeholders who are now on board.*

### 2. Tangible Strategy Plan 📋
- What exactly is the event?
- Who are we inviting and why?
- What will we achieve?
- "Implementable in nature"

### 3. Task Division 👥
- Divide responsibilities clearly
- Leverage individual skill sets
- Recruit more members if needed — but set expectations (time-consuming, skill-based, no monetary reward)
