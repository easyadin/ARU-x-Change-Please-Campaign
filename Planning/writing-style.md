# Writing Style Rules

These apply to every document in this campaign. No exceptions.

## Do Not

- **Chunked phrases.** "This campaign mobilises people around a cause." "This campaign is anchored in a social cause." These are slide headlines, not writing. Weave the concept into a sentence that goes somewhere. Don't let it stand alone as a declaration.
- **Announcer phrases.** "Think of it this way," "The critical distinction is," "What this means is." Just make the statement.
- **Presuppositions.** Don't set up a point before making it. Make the point.
- **Em dashes (—).** Never use them. Use commas, full stops, or rewrite the sentence instead.
- **Attribution as authority.** "This is what Dr Tabish teaches" adds nothing. If the idea is true, it stands on its own.
- **Pronouncements.** "Social enterprise operates on a spectrum." Says who? Don't lecture.
- **Dismissive shorthand.** "The £10,000 target exists but it's not the point." That's shrugging, not writing.
- **Repeating the same point three ways.** Say it once, clearly, and move on.
- **Vague power words.** "Impact," "leverage," "synergy," "mobilise." If you can't replace the word with something concrete, cut it.
- **Pitching when discussing.** The thinking document discusses ethos and philosophy. It's not selling anyone on anything.

## Do

- **Write full, considered sentences.** Each sentence should feel like someone gathered their thoughts before speaking.
- **Use precise, weighted word choices.** "Pressure-tested" is good. It compresses meaning. Choose words that earn their place.
- **Be illustrative.** Diagrams, examples, concrete scenarios. "Anita walks into the SU with..." is better than "stakeholder engagement should be prepared."
- **Let ideas breathe.** Expressive, considered writing. Not shortened, not compressed into bullet-speak.
- **Read it out loud.** If it sounds like someone stumbling through a point or reciting a corporate slide, rewrite it.
- **Be direct.** State things. Don't build up to them.
- **Be human.** This should read like a thoughtful person explaining their thinking, not a document generated by committee.
