---

Hi Daniel,

I hope this finds you well. My name is Israel, and I'm an MBA student at ARU.

I'm leading a student team running a crowdfunding campaign in partnership with **Change Please** — the B Corp social enterprise (UK Social Enterprise of the Year 2025) that trains people experiencing homelessness as baristas, providing a living wage job, housing within 10 days, therapy, and a bank account. They've helped over 3,200 people with an 82% success rate.

We're raising **£10,000** through JustGiving to fund barista training placements directly through the Change Please Foundation. The project originated from Dr. Tabish Zaman's module and has grown into a full campaign with a dedicated team.

We believe this initiative aligns well with what ARU stands for — social mobility, real-world impact, and students going beyond the classroom. We'd value your guidance on how this could gain wider university support, whether through the Faculty, Comms, or any other channels you'd recommend.

I've put together a draft proposal with all the details. You can view it online or via the attached PDF:

Would be grateful for any advice or direction you could offer.

Best regards,
