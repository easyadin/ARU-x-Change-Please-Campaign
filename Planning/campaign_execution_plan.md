# Campaign Thinking Space — ARU × Change Please

> This is not a plan. This is the pool of everything worth thinking about before any plan gets written. Every angle, every perspective, every question, every possibility. No decisions have been made. This feeds into everything that comes next.

## 🎓 Academic

- Dr Tabish's module (MOD007665) is the origin — but this has grown beyond coursework. How do we frame that?
- The academic one-pager exists — who exactly sees it? Dr Tabish uses it to brief faculty, but does it also go to external examiners? REF panel?
- MOD007666 (next module) could potentially integrate the crowdfunding as applied learning — has anyone explored that?
- Is there a way to formalize this as a case study that lives beyond this cohort? Handbook entry? Published case?
- The "inside the classroom to outside the classroom" narrative is powerful for TEF/REF — does the university know this could be evidence?
- What learning outcomes can each team member document? This isn't just about raising money — it's about provable skill application
- Could this become an annual MBA initiative? Does Dr Tabish want that? Does the university?
- Ethics clearance — Dr Tabish owns this. Listed in his responsibilities (campaign_planning.md). Status unknown — needs confirming

## 🏛 Faculty & University

- Dean of FBL (Prof. Mohammad Ali) is excited — but what does "excited" translate to? A faculty-wide email? Funding? Room bookings? His name on the campaign?
- Alicia (MBA Director) — same question. What can she actually do beyond being "aware"?
- Deputy Dean — Prof. Ali recommended speaking to him for entrepreneurship guidance. Has anyone followed up?
- Dan Berger — payment system. Dr Tabish met him Mon 24 Feb. The plan: university provides an internal payment system, resourcing team handles all funds, direct transfer to Change Please, no team member touches money, university certified and regulation compliant. **Status of confirmation unknown — needs following up**
- ARU branding — do we have explicit permission to use the logo? Or is it assumed?
- ARU Comms/Marketing — they have newsletters, digital screens, social accounts. Have we asked?
- ARU Press Office — Jamie Forsyth. Two-line email could get us campus-wide coverage. Has anyone sent it?
- Jo's warning about bureaucracy — "easier to ask forgiveness than permission." Which things do we ask permission for and which do we just do?
- Is there an alumni network we can tap? Faculty of Business & Law alumni specifically?
- Other faculties — this isn't just an FBL story. Social work students? Health science? Could they be interested?
- Campus infrastructure — poster boards, digital screens, notice boards, common areas. What's available and what needs booking?

## 🤝 Change Please

- Leonardo sent a toolkit to Dr Tabish — **forwarded to the team by Israel**. Vivian is assigned to lead on reviewing and incorporating it
- What's in the toolkit (per campaign_planning.md): official fundraising kit, approved logos and branding, impact stats and stories, photos/videos for use, testimonials from graduates. **Vivian needs to review and report back on what's actually usable**
- Marketing Manager connection — what can they actually do for us? Co-create content? Share on their channels? supply speakers?
- Change Please has their own prize draw running (free coffee for 2 years from £5) — can we piggyback on this or run our own version?
- Could Change Please supply coffee for events? Even small amounts as prizes or samples?
- They've offered to send speakers — who? A graduate? Cemal himself? How far in advance do they need?
- Adan's story (executive chef → homeless → saved a life → barista trainer) — documented in research_brief.md. Saved a woman's life jumping into freezing Thames (2010), won George Award for Bravery from the Queen, now trains baristas at Change Please. Usability/permission depends on what's in the toolkit
- The success rate discrepancy: **82%** is used in the proposal, pitch deck, all outreach emails (Daniel Berger, Jo Living, Mohammed Ali), the glasshouse pitch, and the one-pagers. **85%+** appears only in the research_brief.md (compiled Feb 3, earliest document). The 82% is likely the more recent, verified figure. The one-pagers also reference 3,283 lives changed. **All public materials should use 82% and 3,283 consistently**
- JustGiving — Change Please Foundation is the beneficiary. All outreach emails (Daniel Berger, Jo Living, Mohammed Ali) already reference "through JustGiving" and "directly to Change Please Foundation." Campaign_planning.md lists the JustGiving page setup under Phase 2. **The team controls the page, Change Please Foundation receives funds**
- Do they have press contacts or a PR agency that could issue something?

## 👩‍💼 Jo Living & the EiRs

- Jo is personally supportive but AREA officially can't back charitable fundraising. She said this explicitly: AREA "can't officially do this" but she will "personally support." Referencing should be "with the personal support of ARU's Entrepreneurship Manager" not "supported by AREA"
- She explicitly said "come back and bug me for money" — when is the right moment to do that?
- The 10 Entrepreneurs in Residence (all named in jo-living-meeting-24-feb.md): Alex Mann, Lucy Colson, Nick Looby FRSA, Nish Kotak, Stephen Tunnicliffe-Wilson, Dr Tamsin Holland-Brown, Faye Holland (all Cambridge), Karen Tait, Mat Parkins, Paul Nash (all Chelmsford). She gatekeeps these — "please don't reach out to them directly because I manage the relationships." The ask must go through her and be specific
- What would a specific ask look like? "Would you be willing to donate £50 and share with your network?"
- Or is it "Would you be willing to attend our event?" — lower barrier, still gets them in the room
- Jo's "Double or Divide" concept — she brainstormed this live. Is it the right mechanic? Does it need refinement?
- The ice bucket challenge comparison — what made it work: public accountability, nomination, simplicity, visibility. Do we have all four?
- "People give to people, not causes" — this is her #1 message. How does this change what we create?
- Her hierarchy: personal ask > emotional story > social pressure > seeing a good cause online. We're currently at the weakest level
- She mentioned LinkedIn over Instagram for the professional audience — different channel, different voice. Have we thought about what the LinkedIn voice sounds like?
- Her follow-up email with raffle/auction ideas — these are concrete revenue mechanics. Have we explored any?
- Jo said "recruit others — so it's not just one small thing happening in isolation" — SU, FBL, other courses running things under the same campaign umbrella

## 📱 Social Media & Content

- ~~Instagram account — not created yet. What's the handle? Brand identity? First post?~~ **Dr Tabish decided: no dedicated campaign Instagram.** Reach will come through stories and posts from influencer accounts, the Students' Union, and different societies. This changes the social strategy entirely — it's decentralised, not brand-owned
- ~~Vignesh has social media experience — but does he have a content plan or is it freestyle?~~ Vignesh's role shifts: he's not managing an account, he's creating content that OTHER accounts post. What does that workflow look like? Does he create assets and distribute them?
- Content without faces is dead. Jo said it. Every piece of content needs a person in it
- Each team member's personal story — what format? Video? Written? Carousel? All of the above?
- Is there a campaign hashtag? It needs to be short, memorable, and ownable
- The content cadence — how many posts per week is sustainable given everyone has coursework?
- LinkedIn is for a completely different audience than Instagram. Same campaign, different language. Has anyone thought about what professional-facing content looks like?
- User-generated content — once people donate, how do we get them to post about it?
- The "Double or Divide" needs a visual format. What does someone actually post when they nominate someone?
- Behind-the-scenes content — the process of building this campaign is itself a story
- TikTok? Short-form video? Or is that too scattered?
- Coordination with Change Please's social accounts — they have reach we don't

## 🎪 Events

**Dr Tabish's two-event format (confirmed via Anita, Mon 24 Feb):**

**Event 1 — Pre-Launch (Internal)**
- Audience: ARU students and faculty only
- Format: movie screening → campaign introduction (Dr Tabish as guest speaker) → Iftar feast
- Dr Tabish will talk to the university about funds and formality for this
- Date: TBD
- Questions: What movie? Who organises the Iftar? Budget for food? Venue capacity? Is this Ramadan-timed (Ramadan 2026 starts ~late Feb/early March)?

**Event 2 — Formal Launch (External)**
- Audience: people from outside the university — Glasshouse contacts, entrepreneurs, industry contacts
- Format: Change Please guest speaker + other entrepreneurs and industry contacts
- Date: TBD
- Questions: Who is the Change Please speaker? How far in advance do they need? Who handles invitations? Is this ticketed?

**Open questions for both events:**
- Payment at events — how do people actually pay? QR codes? University payment system?
- Venue — campus rooms are free but need booking. Who books? How much lead time?
- Photography/videography — who captures it? This is content for after
- The "ripple effect" — can we get SU, societies running mini-events that feed into the same campaign?
- Jo's activity-based fundraising ideas (raffle, sponge at professor, pay-per-play) — do these fit either event?
- Jo's £5 deposit idea — relevant for the internal event to combat student no-shows?
- Raffle with donated prizes — who approaches local businesses? Jo's follow-up email had concrete ideas here

## 🎯 Fundraising Mechanics

- JustGiving page — not live. This blocks everything. Who sets it up?
- Target: original was £5-10K (campaign_planning.md, Feb 4 meeting). Dr Tabish raised to £10-15K (Feb 20 meeting). All outreach emails use **£10,000** as the figure. The one-pagers don't state a specific target. **£10,000 is the working public number**
- "Frontloading" — crowdfunding research says 30%+ needs to come in week 1. How do we engineer that?
- Who are the first 10 donors? These need to be pre-committed before the campaign goes public
- Matched funding — AREA can't officially, but are there other sources? University matched giving? Corporate match?
- One-off donations vs recurring — JustGiving supports both one-off and monthly donations. Crowdfunding pages typically use one-off
- Donation tiers — JustGiving allows suggested amounts. Research_brief.md says for social enterprises, "backers are motivated by values alignment, not financial returns" — so tiers should feel like impact amounts ("£10 = 1 day of training")
- The psychology of amounts — Jo said "I give 10 and you give 5." Specific suggestions, not open-ended
- Corporate donations — any businesses from Glasshouse willing to donate as organizations?
- In-kind support — things that save budget even if they're not cash (printing, venue, coffee, prizes)
- JustGiving fees — ~5% deducted automatically from donations (campaign_planning.md). Donors can optionally cover the fee at checkout. Gift Aid adds 25% on top for UK taxpayers — Change Please Foundation would need to be registered for Gift Aid (they likely are as a registered charity)
- Tracking: campaign_planning.md already specifies UTM links per channel (`?utm_source=su_newsletter`, `?utm_source=instagram`, `?utm_source=poster_qr`, etc.) and separate QR codes for posters vs events vs digital. JustGiving dashboard tracks total donations, donor count, and timeline. Digital & Social Media Lead owns reporting

## 📰 PR & Press

- Jamie Forsyth (ARU Press Office) — one email could unlock campus-wide coverage. What's the pitch?
- "Two angles": university story (students go beyond coursework) + charity story (Change Please model)
- Cambridge local press — would they run this? It's hyperlocal, feel-good, student-driven
- Change Please PR — do they have an agency? Would they issue a release about the partnership?
- Dr Tabish's podcast — planned for after the event. But should there be one before too? Teaser?
- Does Dr Tabish have media contacts from his research/academic network?
- Student press — does ARU have a student newspaper or radio station?
- Photography — do we have good photos of the team? Of the site visit? Of anything?

---

## 🏫 Students' Union & Societies

- **SU is on board.** Anita spoke to the SU team (Tue 25 Feb). They're happy to support. They asked for a **formal email** requesting support to keep it official and documented. **Someone needs to write and send that email**
- SU agreed to **reshare posts and stories** through their Instagram page if tagged. This is the amplification channel now that there's no campaign Instagram
- SU newsletter — what's the process, deadline, format? Worth asking in the formal email
- SU endorsement — they said they're "happy to be a part of this" but what does that mean concretely beyond resharing? Co-hosting events? Shared promotion? Funding?
- Relevant societies — entrepreneurship, business, social justice, volunteering. Dr Tabish mentioned reaching through "different societies" — who approaches them?
- Could societies run their own mini-fundraisers under the campaign umbrella?
- Cross-campus: Chelmsford campus too? Or just Cambridge?
- **Influencer accounts** — Dr Tabish mentioned these alongside SU and societies. Who are these? Student influencers? Faculty with followings? Change Please's own accounts?

---

## 🌍 External & Community

- Glasshouse contacts — emails and LinkedIn collected at the Feb 20 event (~90 attendees including VCs, charity workers, fundraisers, finance professionals, investment bankers). Contacts showed strong interest in attending the planned campaign event. Suggestions included apprenticeship companies and charity partnerships. **These contacts are now 6+ days cold and need follow-up**
- Local businesses in Cambridge — Change Please buys from local suppliers. Any connections there?
- Could a local coffee shop host a "Change Please day" where proceeds go to the campaign?
- Other universities — is there a precedent for cross-university charity campaigns?
- Media beyond Cambridge — regional BBC? Social enterprise press?
- Cemal Ezel (founder of Change Please) — any chance of involvement? Even a video message?
- Corporate partners of Change Please (Nespresso, NHS) — too big to approach, or worth a shot?

## 🧠 Strategy Questions (The Big Ones)

- What is the campaign actually about? Raising money? Or is it about something bigger — proving that academic learning can translate into real impact?
- Who is the protagonist? The team? Israel? Change Please graduates? The cause itself?
- What's the one sentence someone says when they share this? "My friend is running a campaign to..." — what fills the blank?
- Is this a one-shot (raise money, done) or the start of something ongoing?
- What happens if we don't hit the target? Is £3,000 a failure or a success?
- What does legacy look like? Next cohort picks it up? Or this was a one-time thing?
- Who owns the narrative after the campaign ends? Dr Tabish? The university? Change Please?
- What's the minimum viable version if everything goes wrong and half the team goes quiet?

---

## 🔥 Things Not To Forget

- Change Please toolkit — forwarded to team, **Vivian needs to review it**
- Glasshouse follow-up — these contacts are going cold
- Jo said "if you haven't come back to bug me for money, you haven't done your job"
- Dr Tabish asked for a "tangible strategy plan" — this thinking space feeds into that
- The academic one-pager is ready but hasn't been shown to anyone yet
- Payment infrastructure — solved in principle but not confirmed in practice
- Nobody has directly asked anyone for money yet. The whole campaign hasn't actually started
