# Meeting with Jo Living — 24 Feb 2026
**Entrepreneur in Residence, ARU Cambridge**

> Jo had limited time (roughly 20 minutes). She was thinking out loud, prompting, suggesting, warning — not prescribing. Everything below is extracted from what she said explicitly, what she implied, and what she started but couldn't finish.

---

## 1. The Psychology of Giving

### What She Said
- "People give to people, not causes"
- "There's so many brilliant causes out there" — yours isn't special just because it's good
- "I scroll past them myself" — she's being honest that even she, someone connected to you, doesn't always give
- "I would be more likely to donate to this now because I've got a semi-personal connection to yourself and I'm seeing the hard work you're putting in"
- "If it's just give to this obscure organization — actually, you know..."
- "People don't just give to a random cause. They give to people they're connected with that care."

### What She Meant
- The cause alone is not enough. Change Please being a good charity is necessary but not sufficient
- **Connection** is the deciding factor — not information, not statistics, not even impact
- She's telling you: the 300,000 stat, the 79% stat — that's head. You need heart
- Heart comes from **you as people**, not from the charity's track record
- She literally used herself as the example: she'd give because she knows *you*, not because she read a one-pager

### What She Didn't Finish But Was Getting At
- There's an implied hierarchy of giving motivation:
  1. Someone I know personally asked me → strongest
  2. I feel emotionally moved by a personal story → strong
  3. I feel socially pressured/nominated → moderate
  4. I see a good cause online → weakest (this is where most campaigns sit and fail)
- She's warning you: if you stay at level 4, you'll get likes and shares but not donations

## 2. The "Double or Divide" Concept

### What She Said
- "Nominate someone"
- "Someone who could double"
- "Like a dare challenge"
- "Find someone else to donate or a way to split"
- "Match — double or match"
- "A doubling mechanism"
- "Match or half, I give 10 and you give 5"
- "Double, do, or divide"
- "Giving people the option to double or divide"

### What She Was Thinking Through (Out Loud)
- She was brainstorming the mechanic in real-time — this wasn't a polished idea
- The core concept: every donation creates a chain. You don't just give. You give AND pass it on
- The genius of "double or divide" vs "match": 
  - "Match" means "give the same" — flat, no escalation
  - "Double" creates upward pressure — social pressure to be generous
  - "Divide" gives an escape valve — if someone can't afford £20, they can give £10 and still participate
  - Nobody is excluded, but everyone is challenged
- She referenced the **ice bucket challenge** — what made it work wasn't the charity, it was:
  - Public accountability (you did it on camera)
  - Nomination (your friend called you out)
  - Simplicity (do it or donate)
  - Visibility (everyone could see who participated and who didn't)

### What She Didn't Say But Was Implying
- You need a **format** — what does this look like? Video? Social post? A specific template?
- You need **rules** that are dead simple to explain in one sentence
- "I give £10, I nominate [name], they double or divide" — needs to be that crisp
- The mechanism needs to be **visible** — people need to see others participating
- Think about: what's the visual? What does someone post when they've done their part?
- The chain breaks if there's friction — how easy is it to donate AND nominate in the same action?

## 3. Audience Strategy

### What She Said
- "Think about your target audience"
- "You want people that are in a position to donate more than you want students"
- "But you need both — the critical mass and then the people that could donate"
- "Students is great for amplification of message, but I know student budgets"
- "LinkedIn campaigns, reaching — probably more than Instagram"

### The Two-Track Model She Was Describing

**Track A: Students (Amplification Engine)**
- Purpose: spread the word, create buzz, make it visible, fill events
- Channel: Instagram, campus, SU, word of mouth
- What they give: shares, attendance, small donations, social proof
- Risk: they sign up but don't show up, they like but don't donate

**Track B: Professionals (Donation Engine)**
- Purpose: actual significant donations
- Channel: LinkedIn, personal outreach, through ARU network
- Who: Entrepreneurs in Residence, lecturers, staff, alumni, local business people
- What they give: £25, £50, £100+ — and access to their own networks
- Key insight: these people give because of **relationship to ARU** and **relationship to you**

### What She Didn't Say But Was Clearly Thinking
- Your current strategy is too student-focused
- Instagram posts won't raise £10-15K — that takes real money from real earners
- The EiR list she shared is not decoration — those are the people who can write £50-£100 cheques
- But you can't cold-approach them. It has to come through relationship (hence "go through me")
- The professional audience needs a different **tone** than the student audience — LinkedIn vs Instagram is not just a channel choice, it's a voice choice

## 4. Personal Storytelling

### What She Said
- "It's actually as much about your story"
- "Why you're motivated to do it"
- "What spoke to you in that lecture"
- "What you've learned about social enterprise"
- "Why are you putting yourself out there?"
- "Building public, be a bit vulnerable"
- "Me, I, Israel, here's my story. This is why this resonated with me"
- "Get your colleagues to do the same"

### What She Was Really Saying
- The campaign needs **faces**, not a brand
- Change Please already has a brand. ARU already has a brand. What's missing is **you**
- She specifically said "Israel" — she's telling you to be the protagonist
- "Be a bit vulnerable" — this isn't a corporate pitch. It's "I'm a student, this hit me in that lecture, and I couldn't not act"
- "Get your colleagues to do the same" — Vivian, Mohamed, Anita, Vignesh each have their own story and their own network
- Each person's story activates THEIR network — Israel's story reaches Israel's people, Vivian's reaches Vivian's people
- This is how you get 2nd and 3rd level connections (she explicitly said this)

### The Unsaid Implication
- If the campaign is faceless, it's just another charity link
- If the campaign IS Israel and team, it's a personal ask from someone you know
- The one-pager alone won't do this — you need video, posts, faces, names, personal asks
- She's also saying: your team members need to feel ownership. If only Israel is the face, you only get Israel's network

## 5. Network Mechanics

### What She Said
- "Your network now is your 1st connections"
- "Then you need to pay it forward"
- "You don't just get one level connections — you get the 2nd and 3rd and 4th level"
- "How a campaign will grow... off relationships"
- "It's not just a blanket ask to the internet"
- "I've asked you Joe to give £50 or £25 and have someone else match it"
- "Challenge the next person"

### The Model She's Describing
```
Level 1: You → your direct contacts (Jo, Dr Tabish, friends, family)
Level 2: They share/nominate → their contacts (Jo's network, family friends)
Level 3: Those people → their contacts
Level 4: Viral reach (if the format is compelling enough)
```

### What She's Warning Against
- Posting on Instagram and hoping strangers donate = Level 0 (won't work)
- You MUST start with Level 1 — personal, direct, named asks
- Each Level 1 person is not just a donor — they're a **node** who unlocks their network
- The "Double or Divide" mechanic is designed to force this chain reaction
- Without a forwarding mechanism, your campaign has a dead end at every donation

### The Uncomfortable Truth She Was Hinting At
- "If you haven't come back to bug me for money at some point, then you've not done your job right"
- She's saying: **you need to directly ask people for money**. Not hint. Not post. ASK.
- She's also saying: people EXPECT to be asked. She wants you to ask her
- The discomfort of asking is the barrier most campaigns never cross
- Her EiR list, your lecturers, Dr Tabish — these are all people you should eventually directly ask

## 6. Event Design

### What She Said
- "An event with no food or drink is just people stood in a room"
- "Students are flaky — they sign up but don't show up"
- "What are people showing up to?"
- "Could you sell tickets to the event?"
- "£5 security deposit, refunded at the event if you choose to"
- "Maybe 50% of the people choose not to have it refunded"
- "How are you taking people's money because they don't have cash?"
- "Could you get the Students' Union to do a fundraiser?"
- "Could you get FBL to do an activity?"
- "Recruit others — so it's not just one small thing happening in isolation"

### The Problems She Identified
1. **No budget for refreshments** — so what IS the draw?
2. **No commitment mechanism** — RSVPs mean nothing for students
3. **No interactive element** — standing and listening isn't enough
4. **No payment infrastructure** — how do you actually take money in 2026?
5. **No multiplier effect** — one event in isolation doesn't create ripple

### Activity Ideas She Threw Out
- Pay £2, throw balls through holes → win sweets
- "Throw a sponge at the lecturer" — pay £2 per throw
- She was getting at: fun, low-cost, physical, silly, interactive, shareable
- The activity IS the fundraising, not just an add-on to the event

### The Deposit Idea (Deeper Than It Sounds)
- £5 commitment deposit to attend
- Refunded at event if you want it back
- ~50% will feel social pressure to not ask for refund → instant donation
- Those who paid have skin in the game → they actually show up
- Even those who take refund: they showed up, they're in the room, they might donate separately
- This is a **behavioural economics trick** — commitment bias + social pressure

### What She Was Getting At With "Ripple Effect"
- Don't do one event and call it done
- Get the SU running something. Get FBL running something. Get different courses involved
- Each mini-event feeds into the same campaign — same JustGiving, same branding
- You become a coordinating hub, not the only thing happening
- More touch points = more chances for someone to encounter the campaign

### Payment Logistics (She Flagged But Couldn't Solve)
- Students don't carry cash
- You need QR codes, PayPal, or direct link to donation page on phones
- At the event: how do people actually hand over money?
- This is an unsexy but campaign-killing problem if not solved

## 7. PR & Press

### What She Said
- "Press Officer — Jamie Forsyth"
- "Reporter in Cambridge"
- "Ask Change Please if they can do a PR, press release"

### What She Was Implying
- ARU has an official press office — use it. This is a feel-good university story
- Jamie Forsyth can get you on the ARU website and potentially Cambridge local press
- Change Please likely has a PR company already — they've done press before (they're a known social enterprise)
- A press release from Change Please carries more weight than one from students
- **Two angles**: ARU students doing something remarkable (university angle) + Change Please mission (charity angle)
- Local press in Cambridge = reaches the exact demographic that might donate (local professionals, community)

---

## 8. The Entrepreneurs in Residence

### What She Said
- "10 Entrepreneurs in Residence, typically over 40"
- "Thinking about people with significant access to..."  (she didn't finish — she meant wealth/networks)
- "Please don't reach out to them directly because I manage the relationships with them"
- "They might be able to support or share"

### What She Was Really Saying
- These are high-value nodes in the network — one EiR sharing your campaign is worth 100 student shares
- They have money. They have connections. They have credibility
- But they're **her** relationships — you can't cold-email them
- The ask is: "Jo, would you be willing to introduce us to [name] for [specific purpose]?"
- She'd probably do it if you come back with a compelling, specific ask — not "can you share our link"
- "Support or share" — support could mean donate, sponsor, open doors, lend credibility

### The List (Preserved)
| Name | Location |
|---|---|
| Alex Mann | Cambridge |

## 9. ARU Bureaucracy Warning

### What She Said
- "It is easier to ask for forgiveness than permission"
- "They will drag you in 6 weeks of bureaucracy if you're not careful"
- "Non-responsive staff members that are paper pushers"
- "You didn't hear it from me"
- "Definitely go via the press office, definitely do it the right way"
- "But just a word of warning on going too right on permissions"

### What She Was Really Telling You
- She's speaking from experience — she's seen ARU bury good initiatives in approval chains
- The press office is the RIGHT channel for PR — use it, don't skip it
- But for everything else (room bookings, branding use, event approvals) — don't over-ask
- You have a lecturer (Dr Tabish) behind this. You have the Dean's awareness. That's your cover
- If you wait for official approval on every decision, your campaign window closes
- She said "off the record" and "you didn't hear it from me" — this is genuine insider advice
- Translation: be strategic about what you ask permission for and what you just do

## 10. Things She Started But Couldn't Finish

Jo had 5 minutes at the end and was rushing. Here's what she opened but didn't close:

1. **"Think about people with significant access to..."** — she trailed off. She meant wealth networks. The EiR list was the answer to this unfinished thought

2. **"I don't know what you're going to claim, but like..."** — she was about to suggest specific messaging around local impact (crime, reoffending) but pulled back because she doesn't know your exact positioning

3. **"Are you going to have a motivational speaker? That's entertaining. Or you're going to have activities"** — she was probing whether you've thought about the event experience design at all, not just logistics

4. **"Have you got PayPal on a phone?"** — she flagged payment infrastructure and moved on. This is an unsolved problem she highlighted but left with you

5. **"Could you get the Students' Union to do a fundraiser? Could you get FBL to do an activity and recruit others?"** — she was painting a picture of a distributed campaign, not a single-point event. She didn't have time to elaborate but the idea is: your campaign should be everywhere on campus, not just your one event

6. **"What does that look like visually?"** — referring to the nomination/challenge format. She knows visual format matters (is it a video? A post template? A story?) but didn't have time to help design it

7. **"People want to buy from people they know"** — she said this twice. The repetition was deliberate. This is her #1 message

8. **"And it's exciting, yeah. Well done for everything you've achieved so far"** — she genuinely believes in this. She's not just being polite. The proof: she offered to give money and told you to come bug her for it

---

## 11. Jo's Implicit Offer

She said, near the end:
> "If you haven't come back to bug me for money at some point, then you've not done your job right."

and

> "Let me know how I can support."

This is not pleasantry. She's:
- Offering to donate personally
- Offering to make introductions (through her EiR relationships)
- Offering to advise further ("I'm happy to jump back on")
- Testing whether you'll actually follow through — this is itself part of her assessment of whether this campaign has legs

The follow-up with Jo is not optional. It's a relationship to maintain and activate at the right moment.

## 12. The Meta-Lesson

Jo compressed years of fundraising experience into 20 minutes. The through-line across everything she said:

**Campaigns don't succeed on the quality of the cause. They succeed on the quality of the connections.**

Every single point she made — personal stories, nomination chains, events with commitment, asking Jo herself, leveraging the EiR network, not cold-posting on Instagram — circles back to this one truth.

The cause is the foundation. The connections are the architecture. Without architecture, even the best foundation just sits there.

## 13. Follow-Up Email from Jo — 24 Feb 2026 (13:50)

Jo replied to the thank-you email with three more revenue ideas, unprompted:

### What She Said
> "Could you get Change Please (or other organisation) to offer up a prize and do a raffle for £5 per ticket."

> "Local organisations e.g. hairdressers, gym, restaurants that want to promote their businesses could give prizes for free. You can either sell raffle tickets or have people 'silent auction' ie. Bid the value of the prizes they would pay. People can share their skills or offer (e.g. 1hr 1-1 life coaching, personal training) and then you have people bid on the prizes - highest wins. Just another way to make money."

> "Change please are already offering up this prize which you might be able to leverage. Good luck!"

She attached a screenshot of Change Please's live prize draw: **"Win 2 years of free coffee — a free 200g bag of coffee every month for the next 2 years. Enter the prize draw from £5."** Money raised supports Driving for Change.

### What She Was Adding
1. **Raffle** — get a prize donated, sell £5 tickets. Zero cost to you, pure revenue
2. **Silent auction** — people bid on donated prizes/services. No ceiling on what you can raise per item
3. **Skills auction** — people donate their expertise (coaching, personal training, etc.) as prizes. Costs nothing, raises real money
4. **Local business partnerships** — businesses donate prizes in exchange for promotion. They get visibility, you get inventory to sell against
5. **Change Please's existing prize draw** — already live, already set up. Can you piggyback on it or run a version for the ARU campaign?

### What This Signals
- She's still thinking about this after the call ended
- She went to the Change Please website and found a specific asset you can use
- She's actively helping, not just advising
- The raffle/auction ideas solve the "how do you take money at events" problem she flagged in the meeting
